# Traffic_Sign_Recognition_System

## INTRODUCTION
Road signs are an important part of road safety. Information about the road limitation, Warning, Instruction and other road condition are presented to drivers through these signs placed on the roads, such as traffic signs and traffic lanes. Traffic signs are an important part of road infrastructure to provide information about the current state of the road, restrictions, prohibitions, warnings, and other helpful information for navigation . This information is encoded in the traffic signs visual traits: Shape, color and pictogram . Disregarding or failing to notice these traffic signs may directly or indirectly contribute to a traffic accident. However, in adverse traffic conditions, the driver may accidentally or deliberately not notice traffic signs . In these circumstances, if there is an automatic detection and recognition system for traffic signs, it can compensate for a driver’s possible inattention, decreasing a driver’s tiredness by helping him follow the traffic sign, and thus, making driving safer and easier

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

As the world learning towards fully autonomous vehicles, Understanding and following traffic rules and signs are very crucial . Enabling the vehicle to understand the signs even in the harsh environment could prevent most vehicles accidents ​

Due to the design and colour scheme of traffic lights and signs. It makes difficult for people with visually impaired/colour blinded people from Understanding signs. This system could help them in recognising the signs and take necessary actions according to the instructions given through the sign
